{"audience_analysis": "# Audience Analysis  \n**Profile:**  \n* **Course Topic:** Python Programming  \n* **Audience Type:** Beginner  \n* **Common Job Titles/Background:** 12th standard students with basic computer literacy and little to no programming experience.  \n\n**Key Characteristics:**  \n* **Knowledge Base:** Limited exposure to programming and project management concepts.  \n* **Learning Style:** Likely to benefit from interactive, hands-on activities, visual aids, and real-life examples.  \n* **Motivation:** Interested in acquiring new technical skills that may help in academic and future career opportunities.  \n* **Needs:** Clear, step-by-step guidance; simplified explanations; and ample practice opportunities to build both programming and project management fundamentals.  \n\n**Implications for Instructional Design:**  \n* Use relatable examples and simple language.  \n* Incorporate multimedia elements (videos, interactive demos) to illustrate both Python programming and basic project management concepts.  \n* Provide opportunities for immediate application through projects or case studies that integrate planning, scheduling, and tool usage.", "task_analysis": "Task Analysis\n\n**Key Learning Tasks:**\n\n**Task 1: Understanding Python\u2019s Core Syntax**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will participate in a lecture where core Python syntax, data types (integers, strings, lists), and basic programming concepts like variables and operators are explained. They will also engage in interactive coding exercises to practice writing simple statements.\n- **Assessment:** After the lecture, students will complete an online quiz consisting of 5 multiple-choice questions covering basic syntax elements such as variable declaration, arithmetic operations, and data type conversions.\n\n**Task 2: Writing Simple Python Programs**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will be guided through a series of interactive coding sessions where they write simple programs that use control structures (if statements, loops) to perform specific tasks. They will also be introduced to functions in Python.\n- **Assessment:** Students will develop and execute their own program, which must include at least one if statement and one loop. Their work will be assessed based on the correctness of the code and its functionality.\n\n**Task 3: Utilizing Standard Libraries**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will learn how to import and use standard Python libraries such as math for mathematical operations or os for file handling through interactive sessions.\n- **Assessment:** Students will identify a problem that can be solved using a specific library, write the corresponding code, and explain their reasoning. They will submit this work for review by instructors.\n\n**Task 4: Basic Debugging Techniques**\n- **Learning Activity:** This task includes hands-on practice with debugging tools like Python\u2019s built-in debugger pdb, which helps students understand how to track variable values through a program execution.\n- **Assessment:** Students will be presented with a simple buggy code snippet and asked to find the errors. They need to identify logical or syntax mistakes and correct them in their own version of the code.\n\n**Task 5: Creating Real-world Projects**\n- **Learning Activity:** In this task, students will collaborate on creating a small project that uses Python\u2019s core programming concepts such as functions and control structures. The projects can range from basic scripts to simple interactive applications.\n- **Assessment:** Students\u2019 final submission for this part of the course should demonstrate comprehensive understanding of how to use Python in real-world scenarios. It could include screenshots, videos, or written documentation explaining their project and the learning journey.", "course_topic": "Python Programmimg", "audience_type": "beginner", "terminal_objectives": "1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\r\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\r\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\r\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\r\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "generated_date": "March 18, 2025 at 11:04"}
