They will also work on simple projects that require them to use these concepts.\n- **Assessment:** Completion of a series of exercises that cover variable creation, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, loops, and defining and calling custom functions.\n\n**Task 2:** Basic Python Programs\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will be tasked with creating small programs that implement basic functionalities like calculating the area of a circle, displaying a table of squares for numbers from 1 to 5, or generating and printing a simple pattern. They should also include input/output operations.\n- **Assessment:** Evaluation based on successful completion and execution of these program tasks. The correctness of the code will be assessed by running it through a Python environment.\n\n**Task 3:** Utilizing Standard Libraries\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will study how to use standard libraries such as math, random, and datetime in their Python programs. They will create projects that involve mathematical calculations, generating random numbers, or handling dates/times.\n- **Assessment:** The assessment will measure the student\u2019s ability to integrate these library functionalities into their own code. This will be evaluated by their successful use of standard library functions within their written programs.\n\n**Task 4:** Debugging and Testing\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will participate in hands-on debugging activities, where they identify bugs in provided code snippets or short programs. They should also write tests for simple Python programs to ensure they work as expected.\n- **Assessment:** This is assessed through the completion of exercises focused on identifying errors and fixing them in given code examples. Additionally, a set of test cases that students must write will be evaluated based on how well these tests cover different scenarios.\n\n**Task 5:** Creating Basic Real-World Projects\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will undertake projects such as developing simple games (e.g., Rock Paper Scissors), creating a basic web scraper to extract data from a webpage, or building a small application that connects to an API and presents the results.\n- **Assessment:** This task is evaluated based on successful completion of the project. The quality of code, functionality, and adherence to best programming practices will be assessed.\n\nCourse Objectives:\n1. Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2. Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n3. Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n4. Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n5. Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.\n\nYour task analysis should:\n1. Map learning outcomes to specific instructional activities\n2. Include exactly 5 key learning tasks with bold task titles\n3. Provide specific, concrete learning activities and assessments\n4. Be specific to the Python programming subject matter and appropriate for beginner level learners"}
