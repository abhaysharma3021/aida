They will then complete interactive exercises where they must rewrite simple code snippets to correct syntax errors.\n- **Assessment:** A series of quizzes consisting of multiple-choice questions, in which students choose the correct syntactically correct version from given options.\n\n**Task 2: Writing Simple Programs**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will be provided with a set of problem-solving scenarios (e.g., creating a program to calculate simple arithmetic operations). They will write their own code based on these scenarios and then test it by inputting different data points.\n- **Assessment:** A series of coding challenges where students are given limited time to solve problems using the syntax learned in Task 1. Their solutions will be graded for correctness, efficiency, and adherence to best practices.\n\n**Task 3: Using Data Structures**\n- **Learning Activity:** Participants will learn about Python\u2019s built-in data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries) through a series of lectures and hands-on coding sessions where they manipulate these data types in various operations like sorting, searching, etc.\n- **Assessment:** A set of programming problems that require students to use different data structure functions. The correctness, efficiency, and readability of their code will be assessed.\n\n**Task 4: Implementing Functions**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will study the Python function definition, parameters, return values, and how to call a function within another context. They will practice writing simple functions that perform arithmetic operations, manipulate lists, or simulate simple games.\n- **Assessment:** A quiz where students are asked to define their own functions from given problems, and they are also required to debug errors in provided faulty code snippets.\n\n**Task 5: Debugging Basics**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will be introduced to debugging techniques through practical sessions. They will work on fixing errors found when running a simple program. Activities include identifying the problem areas using print statements, inspecting variables, and understanding control flow issues.\n- **Assessment:** A set of exercises where students identify and resolve bugs in provided code snippets. The effectiveness and efficiency of their debugging methods will be evaluated.\n\n## Course Objectives:\n\n1. Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2.
