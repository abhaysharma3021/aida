Participants will write code snippets in a Python environment to practice these concepts.\n  - **Assessment:** Participants will be assessed through coding exercises where they must correctly implement the syntax taught.\n\n- **Task 2: Writing Simple Programs**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Provide hands-on activities focusing on writing simple programs that use control structures (if statements, loops) and functions. Activities include creating scripts to manipulate strings or perform arithmetic operations.\n  - **Assessment:** Participants will be assessed through quizzes where they must write and run code snippets correctly implementing the learned syntax.\n\n- **Task 3: Utilizing Python Libraries**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Introduce participants to Python\u2019s standard library and common third-party libraries. Activities involve basic tasks such as reading files, handling errors, and working with databases.\n  - **Assessment:** Participants will be assessed through assignments where they must integrate a specific library into their code and perform typical operations using the library.\n\n- **Task 4: Debugging and Testing**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Teach debugging techniques like understanding tracebacks, setting breakpoints, and using print statements. Activities also include writing unit tests for small programs.\n  - **Assessment:** Participants will be assessed through problem-solving exercises where they must identify errors in provided code snippets or write test cases to ensure their own code works correctly.\n\n- **Task 5: Creating Basic Projects**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Guide participants in constructing a small project that utilizes all learned concepts including data handling, control structures, and library use. This could be something like creating a simple calculator program or a basic web scraper.\n  - **Assessment:** Participants will complete and submit their projects for evaluation by the instructor who will assess both functionality and adherence to best practices.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1. Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2. Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n3. Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n4. Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n5. Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects."}
