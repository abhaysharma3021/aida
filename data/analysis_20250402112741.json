They will also complete interactive coding exercises in a learning management system to apply what they've learned.\n- **Assessment:** Completion of 3 out of 5 interactive coding exercises.\n\n**Task 2:** Write Simple Programs\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will be introduced to basic Python programming concepts through structured lessons, including input/output operations and simple calculations. They will then complete a series of guided exercises where they write their own code that performs these tasks.\n- **Assessment:** Submission and review of students' completed programs with at least two corrections provided.\n\n**Task 3:** Utilize Standard Libraries\n- **Learning Activity:** Students are taught about Python's standard libraries, focusing on the `math` module for basic mathematical operations and the `random` module for generating random numbers. They will complete a series of hands-on exercises where they integrate these library functions into their programs.\n- **Assessment:** Submission and review of students' code that correctly utilizes at least two of the mentioned standard libraries.\n\n**Task 4:** Develop Debugging Techniques\n- **Learning Activity:** Students are introduced to basic debugging techniques through guided, step-by-step exercises. They will work on a series of practice problems where they debug simple programs to identify and correct errors.\n- **Assessment:** Submission and review of students' notes detailing the bugs found and corrections made.\n\n**Task 5:** Build Real-World Projects\n- **Learning Activity:** Students are tasked with creating a small project, such as a calculator or a basic game. They will be guided through this process step-by-step, including design planning, coding, testing, and debugging.\n- **Assessment:** Submission of students' final project along with detailed logs showing each stage in their development process.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1.Understand Python's core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "course_topic": "Python Programmimg", "audience_type": "beginner", "terminal_objectives": "1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\r\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\r\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\r\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\r\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "generated_date": "April 02, 2025 at 11:27"}
