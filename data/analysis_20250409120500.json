Use interactive code editors to write and run snippets of code that apply these syntax elements.\r\n- **Assessment:** Create a quiz with 10 multiple choice questions testing knowledge on basic syntax.\r\n\r\n**Task 2: Write and Execute Simple Python Programs**\r\n- **Learning Activity:** Develop simple programs using the learned syntax, including control structures (e.g., conditional statements for if/else blocks) and functions. Include input/output operations to handle user interaction.\r\n- **Assessment:** Submit a program that prompts the user for their name and then greets them with a personalized message. Ensure it correctly handles different types of inputs.\r\n\r\n**Task 3: Utilize Standard Libraries**\r\n- **Learning Activity:** Explore standard libraries such as math, random, datetime, os, etc., and learn how to import and utilize these in Python programs. Write small projects that require library functions like sorting data or generating random numbers.\r\n- **Assessment:** Implement a program that sorts an array of integers using the built-in sort() method from the `sort()` function imported from the `array` module.\r\n\r\n**Task 4: Debugging and Testing**\r\n- **Learning Activity:** Practice debugging techniques by running programs with errors, understanding error messages, and correcting them. Conduct unit tests to ensure functions behave as expected.\r\n- **Assessment:** Provide a code snippet that contains bugs related to control structures or function calls. Students must identify the issues and correct them.\r\n\r\n**Task 5: Create Real-World Projects**\r\n- **Learning Activity:** Work in groups on creating a simple application (e.g., a basic text-based game, calculator, etc.). Use Python's features like object-oriented programming and file handling to create a complex project.\r\n- **Assessment:** Deliver an executable version of the project that runs independently without requiring any external files or libraries. Provide documentation detailing the design decisions and logic used.\r\n\r\nCourse objectives:\r\n1. Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\r\n2. Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\r\n3. Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\r\n4. Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\r\n5. Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects."}
