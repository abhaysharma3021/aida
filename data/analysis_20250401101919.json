{"audience_analysis": "", "task_analysis": "Task Analysis\n\n**Key Learning Tasks:**\n\n**Task 1: Understand Python\u2019s Core Syntax**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will be introduced to basic syntax elements such as variables, data types (integers, strings, lists), control structures (if statements, loops), and functions. They will practice writing simple programs that use these elements.\n- **Assessment:** A quiz where students are asked to write Python code snippets based on given scenarios.\n\n**Task 2: Write and Execute Simple Programs**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will be guided through the process of creating a program that performs basic operations like summing numbers in a list, calculating averages, and determining if a number is even or odd. They will run these programs to see their results.\n- **Assessment:** Students will write and execute their own Python scripts that include functions performing different tasks.\n\n**Task 3: Utilize Standard Libraries**\n- **Learning Activity:** Introduce students to built-in Python libraries such as math for mathematical operations, random for generating numbers or sequences of characters. They will be taught how to use these libraries in simple programs.\n- **Assessment:** Students complete a short programming task requiring the use of at least two different standard library modules.\n\n**Task 4: Debugging and Testing**\n- **Learning Activity:** Provide students with sample code that has bugs intentionally introduced, such as missing function calls or incorrect variable usage. They will be tasked to debug this code using print statements and other debugging tools.\n- **Assessment:** Students write a program which they then test thoroughly by creating expected outputs and checking against the actual results.\n\n**Task 5: Create Basic Real-world Projects**\n- **Learning Activity:** Assign students with small projects like building an application that asks users for their name, age, and favorite color. They should input this data and display it back to them.\n- **Assessment:** Students present a project they have completed in class, detailing how they wrote the code and explaining its functionality.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "course_topic": "Python Programmimg", "audience_type": "beginner", "terminal_objectives": "1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\r\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\r\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\r\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\r\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "generated_date": "April 01, 2025 at 10:19"}
