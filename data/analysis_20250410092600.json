They will also complete exercises using Python\u2019s core syntax like variables declaration (integers, floats), strings, and basic control flow constructs (if-else statements).\n  - **Assessment:** Students\u2019 ability to correctly execute these tasks will be assessed through a series of coding quizzes where they solve problems by writing the appropriate code.\n\n- **Task 2: Basic Data Types**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will engage in practical sessions that involve understanding and working with different data types, including numbers (integers and floats), strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. They will also perform tasks such as adding values to a list or tuple, accessing dictionary elements, and converting between different data types.\n  - **Assessment:** Students will be evaluated through quizzes that require them to write Python code correctly handling various data type operations and conversions.\n\n- **Task 3: Writing Simple Programs with Functions**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will learn how to define functions in their programs. They will then apply this knowledge by writing small, self-contained functions to solve specific problems (e.g., summing numbers within a list). The instructor will facilitate class discussions on the importance and usage of functions.\n  - **Assessment:** Assessments for this task will involve students completing programming assignments that require them to write multiple function-based programs.\n\n- **Task 4: Utilizing Standard Libraries**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will be guided through hands-on activities where they learn to use Python\u2019s standard libraries, such as math and random. They will also implement these library functions in their own programs.\n  - **Assessment:** The assessment for this task will consist of students demonstrating their understanding by writing a program that utilizes at least two different standard library functions.\n\n- **Task 5: Debugging and Testing**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will participate in workshops on debugging techniques, including the use of print statements to debug code. They will also learn how to create unit tests for simple Python programs.\n  - **Assessment:** The final assessment for this task will involve students submitting a piece of their program with bugs or errors and detailing step-by-step how they would identify and correct these issues using debugging techniques.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects."}
