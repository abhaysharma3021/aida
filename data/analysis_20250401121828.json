Students will also be introduced to loops like for and while.\r\n  - **Assessment:** Submit code snippets that demonstrate the correct use of syntax elements discussed in class. \r\n\r\n- **Task 2:** Understand Basic Data Types  \r\n  - **Learning Activity:** Introduce students to different data types such as integers, floats, strings, lists, dictionaries, and sets through interactive examples using Python\u2019s built-in functions like type(), len(), etc.\r\n  - **Assessment:** Answer questions that require selecting or creating code snippets to demonstrate understanding of basic data types.\r\n\r\n- **Task 3:** Write Simple Programs  \r\n  - **Learning Activity:** Guide students in constructing their first small programs. This could involve creating a program that sums up even numbers within a specified range, prompting the student to use if statements and loops.\r\n  - **Assessment:** Have students submit complete Python scripts which include all necessary imports and execute successfully.\r\n\r\n- **Task 4:** Utilize Standard Libraries  \r\n  - **Learning Activity:** Introduce common standard libraries used in Python like math for numerical operations, random for generating pseudo-random numbers, etc. Demonstrate how to use these through simple examples.\r\n  - **Assessment:** Students should demonstrate knowledge by using one of the introduced libraries effectively within a new program.\r\n\r\n- **Task 5:** Develop Debugging and Testing Skills  \r\n  - **Learning Activity:** Teach debugging techniques including setting breakpoints, stepping through code line-by-line, understanding exceptions. Introduce unit testing with frameworks like pytest.\r\n  - **Assessment:** Submit a piece of erroneous Python code that demonstrates the need for debugging or writing test cases to demonstrate understanding of best practices.\r\n\r\nCourse objectives:\r\n1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\r\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\r\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\r\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\r\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "course_topic": "Python Programmimg", "audience_type": "beginner", "terminal_objectives": "1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\r\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\r\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\r\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\r\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "generated_date": "April 01, 2025 at 12:18"}
