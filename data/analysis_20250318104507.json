For instance, they will be instructed to write a script that takes user input and displays the message \"Hello, [user's name]\".\n  - **Assessment:** A short quiz will evaluate whether participants can correctly implement core syntax features such as variable assignment, basic arithmetic operations, and string manipulation using built-in functions like `print()`.\n\n- **Task 2: Write Simple Python Programs**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Participants will work in pairs to develop a program that prompts the user for their age, calculates their age in days (assuming an average of 365 days per year), and then prints out a personalized message based on this calculation. For example, they might receive a greeting like \"You have lived for [number] days.\"\n  - **Assessment:** This task will be assessed by having participants present the program to their peers or facilitator, along with demonstrating how it functions using a provided user input and expected output.\n\n- **Task 3: Utilize Standard Libraries**\n  - **Learning Activity:** In this task, participants will write a simple Python script that utilizes one of Python\u2019s standard libraries. For example, they might use the `datetime` module to print out today's date in a formatted string (e.g., \"Today is January 15th, 2023\").\n  - **Assessment:** Participants will be evaluated on their ability to correctly import and utilize a library, as well as writing code that integrates seamlessly with standard library functions.\n\n- **Task 4: Debugging Practices**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Participants will receive a simple script containing errors. They will need to identify and fix these errors, such as printing out the wrong message or failing to output anything at all.\n  - **Assessment:** The assessment for this task will be based on participants' ability to correctly debug and correct code issues. This can be done via observation during the learning activity or submission of their fixed script for review.\n\n- **Task 5: Apply Python Skills**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Participants will work in groups to develop a basic command-line tool using Python, such as a calculator program that adds two numbers entered by users.\n  - **Assessment:** The assessment for this task will involve the participants presenting their final product. It should include demonstrations of how it functions and perhaps some sample calculations provided by them during the presentation.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1.
