These activities will allow students to practice writing code snippets using these concepts.\n- **Assessment:** A multiple-choice quiz will test the student's understanding of Python\u2019s core syntax.\n\n**Task 2: Write and Execute Simple Python Programs**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will participate in a series of coding workshops where they will write simple programs. These might include writing basic loops, conditional statements, and functions to solve small problems or perform calculations.\n- **Assessment:** The completion of a set of program assignments that students must submit for feedback.\n\n**Task 3: Utilize Standard Libraries and Modules**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will engage in hands-on sessions where they learn about Python\u2019s standard library. They will be instructed to use specific modules (like math, random) and practice importing them into their scripts.\n- **Assessment:** A project requiring students to import and utilize at least three different modules from the Python Standard Library.\n\n**Task 4: Develop Effective Debugging and Testing Practices**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will participate in practical debugging exercises where they are given code with intentional bugs. They must identify errors, understand error messages, and fix issues.\n- **Assessment:** A timed debugging exercise with a set of buggy code that students need to debug within a specified time frame.\n\n**Task 5: Apply Python Skills to Create Basic Real-World Projects**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will work on collaborative projects where they must apply their knowledge of Python syntax, functions, modules, and basic programming concepts. The project might involve creating a simple web server or developing a small game.\n- **Assessment:** A peer-reviewed final project where students present their completed project to the class, along with an explanation of what they've coded and how it works.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1. Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2. Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n3. Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n4. Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n5.
