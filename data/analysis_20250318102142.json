{"audience_analysis": "", "task_analysis": "Task Analysis\n\n**Key Learning Tasks:**\n\n- **Task 1: Understanding Basic Syntax**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will be introduced to basic syntax such as variables, data types (integers, strings), basic operators, and simple mathematical expressions. They will practice writing these in a code editor.\n  - **Assessment:** Students will have to write their own small Python programs that include the use of at least one variable, one arithmetic operation, and one comparison operator.\n\n- **Task 2: Writing Simple Programs**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will be taught how to create simple \"Hello World\" type programs. They will learn to use print statements to output text in their programs.\n  - **Assessment:** Students will write a program that not only prints out \"Hello, world!\" but also includes additional lines of input and manipulation.\n\n- **Task 3: Working with Control Structures**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Introduce basic control structures such as if-statements and loops. Students will be given simple tasks to complete using these structures.\n  - **Assessment:** Students write a program that uses an if-statement to output different messages based on user input, for example, greeting the user by name.\n\n- **Task 4: Utilizing Python Built-in Functions**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Teach students about basic built-in functions such as print(), len(), and input(). They will practice using these in their programs.\n  - **Assessment:** Students write a program that uses several built-in functions to manipulate strings, for example, reversing the order of characters in a string.\n\n- **Task 5: Basic Error Handling**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Introduce concepts of errors and exceptions. Students will be shown how to catch and handle errors using try-except blocks.\n  - **Assessment:** Students write a simple program that attempts to divide two numbers, handling any potential division by zero error gracefully.", "course_topic": "Python Programmimg", "audience_type": "beginner", "terminal_objectives": "1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\r\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\r\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\r\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\r\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "generated_date": "March 18, 2025 at 10:21"}
