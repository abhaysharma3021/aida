Task/Goal:** Develop fundamental skills in Python programming for beginners, enabling them to write simple programs and execute basic computational tasks.\n\n\n**II. Task Breakdown:**\n\n\n**A. Setting Up the Environment**\n\n* **Subtask 1:** Install Python on your computer\n      1. Go to the official Python website (<https://www.python.org/>).\n      2. Download the latest version of Python for your operating system.\n      3. Follow the installation instructions provided by the installer.\n\n* **Subtask 2:** Create a Python project\n      1. Launch a text editor (e.g., Notepad++, Sublime Text, or VS Code).\n      2. Create a new file with a .py extension (e.g., myprogram.py).\n      3. Save the file in a convenient location (e.g., Desktop).\n\n**B. Basic Syntax and Data Types**\n\n* **Subtask 1:** Understand basic Python syntax\n      1.

Familiarize yourself with the print() function.\n\n* **Subtask 2:** Work with basic data types\n      1. Learn about numbers (integers, floating-point numbers).\n      2. Understand the different types of strings (single quotes, double quotes, triple quotes).\n      3. Learn about the boolean data type (True, False).\n\n**C. Control Structures**\n\n* **Subtask 1:** Understand conditional statements\n      1. Learn about if statements (if, elif, else).\n      2. Understand how to use comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=).\n      3. Learn about indentation and block-level statements.\n\n* **Subtask 2:** Understand loops (for, while)\n      1. Learn about using for loops with lists and strings.\n      2. Understand how to use while loops with conditionals.\n      3. Learn about increment and decrement operators.\n\n**D. Functions and Modules**\n\n* **Subtask 1:** Understand functions\n      1. Learn about defining and calling functions.\n      2. Understand keyword arguments (positional, keyword).\n      3. Learn about return types and yield statements.\n\n* **Subtask 2:** Use modules and libraries\n      1. Learn about importing modules (e.g., math, random).\n      2. Understand how to use libraries (e.g., requests, BeautifulSoup).\n      3. Learn about creating and using your own modules.\n\n**E. Debugging and Troubleshooting**\n\n* **Subtask 1:** Use print() for debugging\n      1. Learn about using print() to monitor code execution.\n      2.
