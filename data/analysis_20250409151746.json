They will receive immediate feedback on their code.\r\n- **Assessment:** Students will be assessed through a set of coding challenges where they must write and submit Python programs containing the correct syntax elements.\r\n\r\n**Task 2: Writing Simple Programs**\r\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will work on small group projects that require them to combine basic syntax skills to create simple yet functional programs, such as creating a program that calculates user input for their age then outputs whether they are an adult or not.\r\n- **Assessment:** The assessment will be based on the correct execution of tasks in the project. Feedback provided by instructor and peer review.\r\n\r\n**Task 3: Utilizing Python Libraries**\r\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will learn to use basic Python libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas through guided examples and practice with specific functions within these libraries.\r\n- **Assessment:** The students will demonstrate their understanding by writing code that incorporates one of the mentioned libraries into a simple data analysis or visualization project.\r\n\r\n**Task 4: Debugging Techniques**\r\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will participate in workshops where they are presented with sample buggy Python programs. They must identify and correct bugs, providing explanations for why the corrections were necessary.\r\n- **Assessment:** The assessment involves submitting corrected code along with a brief explanation of issues found.\r\n\r\n**Task 5: Applying Knowledge to Projects**\r\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will undertake a group project where they apply all their Python skills to create a basic web application or interactive game. They are expected to choose and integrate libraries that fit the project's requirements.\r\n- **Assessment:** The final assessment will evaluate the correctness, functionality, and overall quality of the students' projects.\r\n\r\nCourse objectives:\r\n1. Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\r\n2. Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\r\n3. Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\r\n4. Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\r\n5. Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects."}
