{"audience_analysis": "# Audience Analysis  \nProfile:  \n* Course Topic: Python Programming  \n* Audience Type: Beginner  \n* Common Job Titles/Background: 12th standard students, typically with basic computer literacy and little to no programming experience.  \n\nKey Characteristics:  \n* Knowledge Base: Limited exposure to programming and project management concepts.  \n* Learning Style: Likely to benefit from interactive, hands-on activities, visual aids, and real-life examples.  \n* Motivation: Interested in acquiring new technical skills that may help in academic and future career opportunities.  \n* Needs: Clear, step-by-step guidance; simplified explanations; and ample practice opportunities to build both programming and project management fundamentals.  \n\nImplications for Instructional Design:  \n* Use relatable examples and simple language.  \n* Incorporate multimedia elements (videos, interactive demos) to illustrate both Python programming and basic project management concepts.  \n* Provide opportunities for immediate application through projects or case studies that integrate planning, scheduling, and tool usage.", "task_analysis": "Task Analysis</no value>\n\n# Task Analysis\n\n**Key Learning Tasks:**\n\n- **Task 1: Understanding Core Syntax**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will participate in interactive workshops where they can write simple programs using the basic syntax of Python, including variables, print statements, and mathematical operations. They will also be introduced to control structures like if-statements and loops through hands-on exercises.\n  - **Assessment:** At the end of each session, students will submit a brief program that demonstrates their understanding of core syntax concepts (e.g., defining variables, using print statements). The instructor will review these submissions to provide feedback.\n\n- **Task 2: Working with Data Types**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will engage in guided tutorials where they practice converting between different data types such as integers, floats, strings, and lists. They will also perform basic operations like arithmetic on these data types.\n  - **Assessment:** Assessments will include quizzes that require students to manipulate various Python data types (e.g., adding two numbers with a string, concatenating strings, etc.). The assessment will be scored based on accuracy and understanding of the core concepts involved.\n\n- **Task 3: Utilizing Functions**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will learn how to define their own functions in Python by taking part in coding exercises where they create small utility functions. They'll also explore built-in functions like len(), min(), max(), etc.\n  - **Assessment:** The students will be given a set of problems, such as creating a function that calculates the length of a list, and another function to find the maximum value within a list. They are expected to submit their code for review where instructors can provide constructive feedback.\n\n- **Task 4: Using Standard Libraries**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will learn how to use Python\u2019s standard libraries by following detailed instructions on common operations like working with files, handling exceptions, and using the datetime module.\n  - **Assessment:** The assessment will involve a small project where students have to read data from a file, handle errors that may occur during execution (e.g., reading a non-existent file), and print formatted output. Their submission will be checked for correct implementation of these features.\n\n- **Task 5: Debugging and Testing**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will learn basic debugging techniques through hands-on exercises where they encounter common issues in their code, such as syntax errors or logical flaws. They\u2019ll also engage in a session on automated testing using unittest.\n  - **Assessment:** This task will include an assignment asking students to identify and fix bugs within given Python programs that intentionally contain mistakes. Instructors will provide hints and solutions upon submission.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "course_topic": "Python Programmimg", "audience_type": "beginner", "terminal_objectives": "1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\r\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\r\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\r\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\r\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "generated_date": "April 09, 2025 at 09:48"}
