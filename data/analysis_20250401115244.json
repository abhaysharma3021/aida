{"audience_analysis": "", "task_analysis": "Task Analysis\n\n**Key Learning Tasks:**\n\n**Task 1: Understanding Python Syntax**\n- **Learning Activity:** Begin with a guided explanation of basic syntax elements such as variables, data types (integers, strings), conditional statements (if, elif, else), loops (for, while), and functions. Participants will practice writing simple expressions and statements in the console.\n- **Assessment:** Have participants create their first Python program that performs a straightforward task like printing \"Hello, World!\" to the screen, and then execute it using an integrated development environment (IDE).\n\n**Task 2: Working with Data Types**\n- **Learning Activity:** Introduce more complex data types including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Provide hands-on practice through interactive exercises that involve creating and manipulating these data structures.\n- **Assessment:** Participants will write a program to create, modify, and display elements within the various data types introduced in this task.\n\n**Task 3: Control Structures**\n- **Learning Activity:** Dive into control structures by learning about boolean logic operations (and, or, not), logical operators, and comparison operators. Use these concepts to craft simple conditional statements and loops.\n- **Assessment:** Participants will build a program that uses various combinations of conditions and loops to perform an outlined task, such as sorting numbers in ascending order.\n\n**Task 4: Utilizing Functions**\n- **Learning Activity:** Teach participants about defining functions with parameters, return values, and docstrings. Demonstrate how to call functions within other parts of the codebase.\n- **Assessment:** Participants will write a program that includes multiple functions performing distinct operations such as calculating factorials or determining whether a given year is a leap year.\n\n**Task 5: Debugging and Testing**\n- **Learning Activity:** Introduce basic debugging techniques, including setting breakpoints, stepping through lines of code, and using print statements to understand the flow of execution. Participants will also be introduced to unit testing.\n- **Assessment:** Participants will submit their first assignment that includes several small functions, some of which they need to debug based on provided output or errors.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1. Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2. Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n3.
