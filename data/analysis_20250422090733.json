Task/Goal:** In this beginner-level course, students will learn the fundamental concepts and skills of Python programming, enabling them to write simple scripts, understand basic syntax, and apply programming principles to solve everyday problems.\n\n\n**II. Task Breakdown:**\n\n\n**A. Setting Up and Understanding Python**\n\n* **1.1. Installing Python:** Download and install the latest version of Python from the official Python website.\n    1.1.1. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\n    1.1.2. Verify the installation by opening a terminal/command prompt and typing `python --version`.\n* **1.2. Basic File Operations:** Create, read, and write text files using Python.\n    1.2.1. Use the `open()` function to open a file in read or write mode.\n    1.2.2. Use the `read()` or `write()` methods to manipulate file contents.\n    1.2.3. Use the `close()` method to close the file.\n\n**B. Basic Syntax and Control Structures**\n\n* **2.1. Writing Python Code:** Write a simple Python program using the `print()` function.\n    2.1.1. Use indentation to define code blocks.\n    2.1.2. Use the `print()` function to output text.\n* **2.2. Conditional Statements:** Use `if` and `else` statements to control the flow of a program.\n    2.2.1. Write a simple condition using `if` and `else` statements.\n    2.2.2. Use the `elif` statement to handle additional conditions.\n\n**C. Functions and Data Types**\n\n* **3.1. Writing Functions:** Define and call a simple function using the `def` keyword.\n    3.1.1. Use the `def` keyword to define a function.\n    3.1.2. Pass arguments to a function.\n* **3.2. Basic Data Types:** Work with built-in data types such as strings, integers, and booleans.\n    3.2.1. Use the `type()` function to check the data type of a variable.\n    3.2.2. Perform basic operations on strings and integers.\n\n**D. Lists and Dictionaries**\n\n* **4.1. Lists:** Create, index, and manipulate lists.\n    4.1.1. Create an empty list using `[]`.\n    4.1.2. Use the `index()` method to access a list element.\n* **4.2. Dictionaries:** Create and access dictionary key-value pairs.\n    4.2.1. Create a dictionary using the `{}` syntax.\n    4.2.2. Use the `keys()` method to access dictionary keys.\n\n**E. Input and Output**\n\n* **5.1. Reading User Input:** Use the `input()` function to read user input.\n    5.1.1. Use the `input()` function to read a string from the user.\n    5.1.2. Convert user input to a different data type (e.g., integer or float).\n* **5.2. Outputting Results:** Use the `print()` function to output results.\n    5.2.1. Use the `print()` function to output a string or other data type.\n    5.2.2. Use the `format()` method to format output strings."}
