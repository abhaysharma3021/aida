They will then be assessed on the accuracy of their code.\n- **Assessment:** Through an auto-generated quiz that checks for the correct use of syntax within a provided framework.\n\n**Task 2: Working with Data Types**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students participate in interactive activities where they practice different data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans. They will be assessed on their ability to accurately define these variables and perform operations using Python's built-in functions.\n- **Assessment:** An online quiz that requires students to declare variables of various types and demonstrate understanding by performing simple arithmetic and comparison operations.\n\n**Task 3: Control Structures**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students are introduced to conditional statements (if, else) and loops (for, while). They practice writing code using these structures within a series of coding challenges. Assessment will be through an automated test suite that runs their programs under different conditions.\n- **Assessment:** An auto-test environment where students run their program with various inputs and check whether the output matches expected results.\n\n**Task 4: Functions**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students are shown how to create custom functions using Python. They will practice defining simple functions, including function calls within other functions and understanding parameters and return values. Their knowledge will be assessed through a series of programming tasks where they must implement their own functions.\n- **Assessment:** A hands-on assignment where students write and test their own function that processes user input (e.g., taking an integer as input, calculating factorial).\n\n**Task 5: Utilizing Standard Libraries**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students explore common Python libraries such as NumPy for numerical operations or Pandas for data manipulation. They will be guided through using these libraries to solve problems like analyzing a small dataset and plotting basic charts. This task involves a project where students choose one of the libraries to apply, report findings and present their solution.\n- **Assessment:** A final project in which they demonstrate their ability to use at least one library effectively by completing an analytical or graphical activity related to real-world data. Their submission will be evaluated based on both correctness and efficiency.\n\nCourse Objectives:\n1. Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2.
