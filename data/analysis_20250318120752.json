{"audience_analysis": "# Audience Analysis  \n**Profile:**  \n* **Course Topic:** Python Programming  \n* **Audience Type:** Beginner  \n* **Common Job Titles/Background:** High school students, typically with basic computer literacy and little to no programming experience.  \n\n**Key Characteristics:**  \n* **Knowledge Base:** Limited exposure to programming concepts.\n* **Learning Style:** Likely to benefit from interactive, hands-on activities, visual aids, and real-life examples.\n* **Motivation:** Interested in acquiring new technical skills that may help in academic or future career opportunities.\n* **Needs:** Clear, step-by-step guidance; simplified explanations; and ample practice opportunities to build both programming and project management fundamentals.  \n\n**Implications for Instructional Design:**  \n* Use relatable examples and simple language.\n* Incorporate multimedia elements (videos, interactive demos) to illustrate Python programming concepts.\n* Provide opportunities for immediate application through projects or case studies that integrate planning, scheduling, and tool usage.", "task_analysis": "Task Analysis\n\n**Key Learning Tasks:**\n\n- **Task 1: Understand Python's Core Syntax**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Conduct a series of hands-on coding sessions that focus on basic syntax, including variables, data types (integers, floats, strings), and simple operations such as arithmetic. Participants will also practice writing and executing their own small programs.\n  - **Assessment:** An in-class quiz to test understanding of the core syntax topics covered.\n\n- **Task 2: Use Basic Programming Concepts**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Provide guided exercises that involve using loops (for, while), conditionals (if, elif, else), and functions. These activities should be designed so participants can see how these concepts work together in simple programs.\n  - **Assessment:** A practical exercise where students build a program involving all the elements of Task 1 and use basic control structures to manipulate data.\n\n- **Task 3: Utilize Standard Libraries**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Introduce Python's standard library, covering modules like math for mathematical operations, datetime for date and time manipulation, and random for generating random numbers. Participants will be guided through a simple project that utilizes these libraries.\n  - **Assessment:** An assignment where students create their own small application (like a calculator or basic game) using one or more of the standard library modules.\n\n- **Task 4: Develop Effective Debugging Practices**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Introduce common debugging techniques such as logging, print statements, and exception handling. Participants will work on small projects that have known bugs, and they will be guided through troubleshooting these issues.\n  - **Assessment:** A debugging exercise where students are given a snippet of code with an error and must find the issue and correct it.\n\n- **Task 5: Build Basic Projects**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Instruct participants to develop basic projects such as creating a simple calculator, developing a game (like hangman or rock-paper-scissors), or building a small data analysis tool. The key is that these should be achievable within the scope of what students have learned so far.\n  - **Assessment:** Completion and functionality testing of student-built projects.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1.
