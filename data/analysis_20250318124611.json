{"audience_analysis": "", "task_analysis": "Task Analysis\n\n**Key Learning Tasks:**\n\n- **Task 1:** Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n  - **Learning Activity:** Attend lectures where key topics such as variables, control flow (if statements, loops), functions, lists, dictionaries, tuples are covered. Participate in interactive coding sessions that allow students to practice writing simple programs using these constructs. Engage with exercises that require identifying syntax errors and understanding the impact of different code snippets.\n  - **Assessment:** Complete a set of programming exercises that reinforce the core syntax taught during the lecture. This may involve tasks like creating basic programs (e.g., calculating a sum, determining whether a number is even or odd) using variables and control structures.\n\n- **Task 2:** Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n  - **Learning Activity:** Engage in coding exercises where students are required to write programs that use loops for repeated tasks and if statements to make decisions within the program. Practice writing more complex functions, including parameters and return values. The activities will involve hands-on practice with actual programming examples and small projects such as creating a simple calculator or a guessing game.\n  - **Assessment:** Write and execute code in a lab environment where students can be evaluated on their ability to correctly use control structures and functions within programs.\n\n- **Task 3:** Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n  - **Learning Activity:** Conduct practice sessions on how Python\u2019s standard library can be used to simplify coding. This may include using the datetime module for date manipulation, or random module for generating numbers and strings. Participate in activities where students are encouraged to use these built-in features of Python and learn about their functionality through practical examples.\n  - **Assessment:** Students will perform tasks such as importing necessary libraries, writing programs that require specific library functionalities (e.g., reading a file), or implementing basic operations within the library.\n\n- **Task 4:** Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n  - **Learning Activity:** Conduct coding exercises where students are tasked with fixing errors in their previous assignments. Introduce them to common tools for debugging, such as print statements, logging, IDE built-in debuggers. Participants will be guided through the process of identifying bugs by following a step-by-step guide and understanding how different types of errors occur.\n  - **Assessment:** Students are assessed on their ability to identify issues in code and resolve them effectively. They may be given exercises where they need to find and fix logical or syntactical errors, as well as tests that measure their proficiency in debugging.\n\n- **Task 5:** Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.\n  - **Learning Activity:** Assign individual or group projects based on real-world scenarios such as building a simple web server using Flask, creating an automated data processing pipeline with Pandas and NumPy libraries, or designing a game application. These assignments will require students to apply their knowledge of Python syntax, libraries, and functions in practical applications.\n  - **Assessment:** Evaluate the projects based on functionality, adherence to deadlines, use of correct syntax, understanding of coding best practices, and overall quality of output.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1.
