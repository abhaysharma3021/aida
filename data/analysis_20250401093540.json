{"audience_analysis": "# Audience Analysis  \n**Profile:**  \n* **Course Topic:** Python Programming  \n* **Audience Type:** Beginner  \n* **Common Job Titles/Background:** 12th standard students, typically with basic computer literacy and little to no programming experience.  \n\n**Key Characteristics:**  \n* **Knowledge Base:** Limited exposure to programming and project management concepts.\n* **Learning Style:** Likely to benefit from interactive, hands-on activities, visual aids, and real-life examples.\n* **Motivation:** Interested in acquiring new technical skills that may help in academic and future career opportunities.\n* **Needs:** Clear, step-by-step guidance; simplified explanations; and ample practice opportunities to build both programming and project management fundamentals.\n\n**Implications for Instructional Design:**  \n* Use relatable examples and simple language.\n* Incorporate multimedia elements (videos, interactive demos) to illustrate both Python programming and basic project management concepts.\n* Provide opportunities for immediate application through projects or case studies that integrate planning, scheduling, and tool usage.", "task_analysis": "Task Analysis\n\n**Key Learning Tasks:**\n\n**Task 1: Understanding Core Syntax**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will be introduced to basic syntax of Python, including variables, data types (integers, floats, strings), operators, and simple arithmetic operations. They will also learn about conditional statements like `if`, `elif`, and `else`. \n- **Assessment:** Students will complete a series of practice problems where they must correctly write out each part of the syntax.\n\n**Task 2: Writing Basic Programs**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will be guided through creating simple programs that involve using basic Python constructs like loops (`for` and `while`) and functions. They will write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.\n- **Assessment:** Students will submit code for the above task, which will be graded on correct syntax usage, proper indentation, and functionality as expected.\n\n**Task 3: Utilizing Standard Libraries**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will learn about some of Python's built-in modules (e.g., `math`, `random`). They will use these to perform operations like calculating square roots or generating random numbers.\n- **Assessment:** A quiz where students choose the appropriate function from a given list and explain its usage in simple code snippets.\n\n**Task 4: Debugging Techniques**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will work on short programs with common errors. They will be encouraged to run their code and observe the console output, then debug it step by step.\n- **Assessment:** A group activity where students share solutions for common bugs they found in a shared program written collaboratively.\n\n**Task 5: Creating Projects**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will work on building small projects such as writing a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They will also integrate the use of `math` library to handle math operations.\n- **Assessment:** A final project presentation where students explain their project's functionality and showcase it in action.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1.
