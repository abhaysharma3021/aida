{"audience_analysis": "# Audience Analysis  \nProfile:  \n* Course Topic: Python Programming  \n* Audience Type: Beginner  \n* Common Job Titles/Background: 12th standard students with basic computer literacy and little to no programming experience.  \n\nKey Characteristics:  \n* Knowledge Base: Limited exposure to programming, with no background in project management concepts.  \n* Learning Style: Likely to benefit from interactive, hands-on activities, visual aids, and real-life examples.  \n* Motivation: Interested in acquiring new technical skills that may help in academic and future career opportunities.  \n* Needs: Clear, step-by-step guidance; simplified explanations; and ample practice opportunities to build both programming and project management fundamentals.  \n\nImplications for Instructional Design:  \n* Use relatable examples and simple language.  \n* Incorporate multimedia elements (videos, interactive demos) to illustrate both Python programming and basic project management concepts.  \n* Provide opportunities for immediate application through projects or case studies that integrate planning, scheduling, and tool usage.  \n\nAdditional details to consider:  \n- Industry context: Not applicable as this is a beginner course without industry-specific focus.  \n- Audience challenges: Limited prior knowledge of programming and project management.  \n- Prior knowledge: Basic computer literacy.  \n- Course objectives: 1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts. 2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions. 3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks. 4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability. 5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "task_analysis": "Task Analysis\n\n**Key Learning Tasks:**\n\n- **Task Name:** Understand Python\u2019s Core Syntax\n  - **Learning Activity:** \n    - Review basic Python syntax, including variables, data types (integers, floats, strings), control structures (if/else statements, loops), and functions. Participants will complete exercises that reinforce these concepts.\n  - **Assessment:**\n    - Short quizzes assessing comprehension of core syntax rules.\n\n- **Task Name:** Write Basic Programs Using Control Structures\n  - **Learning Activity:** \n    - Construct simple Python programs using if/else statements to handle conditional logic, and for/while loops for iteration. Participants will develop a program that uses both structures.\n  - **Assessment:**\n    - Peer review of completed projects; each project should include proper use of at least one control structure.\n\n- **Task Name:** Write Basic Programs Using Functions\n  - **Learning Activity:** \n    - Write programs utilizing basic functions, including function definitions and calls. Participants will also debug simple functions to correct syntax errors.\n  - **Assessment:**\n    - In-class coding exercise where participants demonstrate the ability to correctly define and use at least one function.\n\n- **Task Name:** Utilize Standard Libraries for Common Tasks\n  - **Learning Activity:** \n    - Learn how to import standard Python libraries (like math or os) and utilize their functions. Participants will write a program that utilizes at least two different library modules.\n  - **Assessment:**\n    - Written test assessing understanding of library syntax and function usage.\n\n- **Task Name:** Develop Debugging and Testing Practices\n  - **Learning Activity:** \n    - Apply fundamental debugging techniques to identify and resolve common programming errors. Participants will be given a simple program with an error, and must debug it.\n  - **Assessment:**\n    - Group discussion on the most effective debugging methods used.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "course_topic": "Python Programmimg", "audience_type": "beginner", "terminal_objectives": "1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\r\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\r\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\r\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\r\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "generated_date": "April 02, 2025 at 11:40"}
