They will also be introduced to functions and modules.\n- **Assessment:** At the end of each session, students will write and run their own short Python scripts that incorporate the new concepts covered in class.\n\n**Task 2: Writing Simple Programs Using Control Structures**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will work through a series of guided exercises where they use if-statements to make decisions within their programs. They will also learn how to loop through data using for-loops and while-loops, applying these structures to solve small problems.\n- **Assessment:** After completing the practice sessions, students will be given an assignment to develop a simple program that requires conditional logic (using if-statement) and iterative processes (using loops), with specific outcomes they must meet.\n\n**Task 3: Utilizing Standard Libraries**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will explore the use of Python\u2019s built-in libraries like math for mathematical operations, random for generating random numbers, and collections for data manipulation. They will learn how to import these modules into their programs and practice using them in various examples.\n- **Assessment:** In a practical exercise, students will be asked to apply at least three different library functions within one of their own programs to solve a problem or complete an activity.\n\n**Task 4: Implementing Effective Debugging Strategies**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will engage in activities that simulate debugging scenarios. This might involve running code snippets and identifying bugs, then correcting them through the process of stepping through the code line by line using tools like print statements to track flow.\n- **Assessment:** To evaluate their understanding, students will be given a set of failing Python programs with various bugs introduced into each one. They must identify the issue(s) present in each program and debug it/them.\n\n**Task 5: Creating Basic Real-world Projects**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will choose from a selection of pre-defined project ideas (e.g., creating a simple calculator, drawing shapes using Turtle graphics). In small groups or individually, they will develop their chosen projects from initial planning to final product.\n- **Assessment:** The assessment for this task will be based on the quality and completeness of each student's final project. This includes checking if all specified functionalities work correctly as expected, correctness of code, adherence to Python coding best practices, and documentation.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1.
