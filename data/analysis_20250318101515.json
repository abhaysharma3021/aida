{"audience_analysis": "", "task_analysis": "Task Analysis\n\n**Key Learning Tasks:**\n\n- **Task Name:** Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n  - **Learning Activity:** Participants will work through a series of guided exercises that involve writing short programs to practice understanding the basics of Python's syntax (such as variables, loops, conditionals), data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets), and fundamental programming constructs like functions and control structures. They'll also learn about basic error handling and debugging techniques.\n  - **Assessment:** Participants will be asked to write programs that demonstrate their understanding of the core concepts covered in this task, with a focus on applying syntax correctly and using data types appropriately.\n\n- **Task Name:** Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n  - **Learning Activity:** Participants will engage in hands-on coding exercises where they practice writing simple scripts that use basic control structures (like if/else statements and for loops) as well as function definitions. They\u2019ll also explore how to structure their code properly, including proper indentation and commenting practices. \n  - **Assessment:** The assessment will involve participants creating a program from scratch or completing parts of a given task where they implement conditional logic and loop structures within their Python programs.\n\n- **Task Name:** Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n  - **Learning Activity:** This task involves learning how to use pre-written code in the form of libraries, such as math, random, and datetime. Participants will also be taught about importing external modules. They'll write simple scripts that demonstrate their understanding of these concepts by integrating standard library functions into their programs to perform tasks like generating random numbers or handling date/time operations.\n  - **Assessment:** Participants will demonstrate their ability to use standard Python libraries in a practical scenario, such as creating a program that generates multiple random dice rolls and prints the results.\n\n- **Task Name:** Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n  - **Learning Activity:** This task includes teaching participants how to write clear, readable code that is easy to maintain. They'll learn about basic debugging techniques (like using print statements) and will be introduced to tools like PyLint for static code analysis. Participants will also gain experience with unit testing by writing simple tests for their programs.\n  - **Assessment:** The assessment will involve participants fixing errors in a sample program that has been deliberately broken, as well as creating and running their own unit tests to ensure the reliability of their code.\n\n- **Task Name:** Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.\n  - **Learning Activity:** Participants will be given a set of requirements for a simple project (like developing an app or website) and will work in teams or individually to design, implement, and debug their solutions. They'll learn how to choose appropriate data structures, use standard libraries effectively, and apply debugging and testing strategies.\n  - **Assessment:** This task will be assessed based on the final product's functionality, adherence to project requirements, and documentation of development process including any unit tests that were written.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "course_topic": "Python Programmimg", "audience_type": "beginner", "terminal_objectives": "1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\r\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\r\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\r\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\r\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "generated_date": "March 18, 2025 at 10:15"}
