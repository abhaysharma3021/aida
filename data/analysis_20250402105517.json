{"audience_analysis": "# Audience Analysis  \nProfile:  \n* Course Topic: Python Programming  \n* Audience Type: Beginner  \n* Common Job Titles/Background: 12th standard students, typically with basic computer literacy and little to no programming experience.  \n\nKey Characteristics:  \n* Knowledge Base: Limited exposure to programming and project management concepts.  \n* Learning Style: Likely to benefit from interactive, hands-on activities, visual aids, and real-life examples.  \n* Motivation: Interested in acquiring new technical skills that may help in academic and future career opportunities.  \n* Needs: Clear, step-by-step guidance; simplified explanations; and ample practice opportunities to build both programming and project management fundamentals.  \n\nImplications for Instructional Design:  \n* Use relatable examples and simple language.  \n* Incorporate multimedia elements (videos, interactive demos) to illustrate both Python programming and basic project management concepts.  \n* Provide opportunities for immediate application through projects or case studies that integrate planning, scheduling, and tool usage.", "task_analysis": "Task Analysis\n\n**Key Learning Tasks:**\n\n- **Task 1: Understanding Basic Syntax**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will participate in interactive lessons that cover basic syntax of Python, such as variable declaration, arithmetic operations, conditional statements (if, else), and loops. They will also practice writing simple scripts under teacher supervision.\n  - **Assessment:** Short quizzes on correct execution of basic syntactical constructs provided by the instructor.\n\n- **Task 2: Basic Data Types**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will engage in hands-on sessions where they learn about Python's different data types like integers, floats, strings, and lists. They'll be assigned exercises to convert between these types and apply them in simple problems.\n  - **Assessment:** Written assignments requiring students to manipulate and display various basic data types.\n\n- **Task 3: Functions Introduction**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Instructive sessions will introduce the concept of functions, their syntax, and how to use pre-defined Python functions. Students will be required to write a few simple functions on their own under guided supervision.\n  - **Assessment:** Evaluation of students' written functions for correctness and efficiency.\n\n- **Task 4: Control Structures**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Lessons will include detailed explanations of control structures like loops, conditional statements, and how they are used. Students will write programs that utilize these constructs in multiple scenarios to enhance their understanding.\n  - **Assessment:** Testing tasks where students need to apply learned control structures within complex problem-solving assignments.\n\n- **Task 5: Utilizing Libraries**\n  - **Learning Activity:** This task involves an introduction and practice session with Python's standard library modules such as math, random, etc. Students will learn how these libraries can be imported into a program to perform various operations.\n  - **Assessment:** Projects requiring students to incorporate at least one of the learned libraries in their solution, demonstrating comprehension and practical use.\n\nCourse Objectives:\n1.
