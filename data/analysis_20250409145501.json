They will also work on understanding the basic syntax like indentation and comments.\r\n- **Assessment:** Assessments include code completion exercises that test their ability to write correct Python code, including proper use of keywords and syntax.\r\n\r\n**Task 2:** Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures (e.g., if statements, loops) and functions.\r\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will be guided through creating small scripts where they need to implement basic conditional logic or repetitive operations. They will also learn about defining their own functions in Python.\r\n- **Assessment:** The assessment consists of a series of short coding challenges that require students to use control structures and define simple functions. These assignments include both automated tests as well as manual code review.\r\n\r\n**Task 3:** Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks (e.g., handling files, managing dates).\r\n- **Learning Activity:** Through hands-on sessions, students will learn about several key Python libraries such as `os` for file operations and `datetime` for dealing with time. They will write programs that demonstrate the use of these libraries.\r\n- **Assessment:** Students' understanding will be evaluated through coding projects where they must integrate at least one library in a problem-solving context. The assessment includes both automated tests to check if libraries are being used correctly, as well as peer and instructor reviews.\r\n\r\n**Task 4:** Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\r\n- **Learning Activity:** This task involves exercises where students receive basic buggy Python programs from which they must identify issues and correct them. They will also learn about writing unit tests for small functions or pieces of code.\r\n- **Assessment:** Assessment is through a set of programming tasks in which the student is given an error-prone program that needs debugging, along with some test cases. Students are expected to provide their corrected version of the program and documentation on what changes they made.\r\n\r\n**Task 5:** Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.\r\n- **Learning Activity:** This task focuses on applying all prior knowledge to develop a small project or application that demonstrates practical use of Python concepts such as file handling, user input/output, etc. Students will work in pairs or groups and present their final projects at the end of the course.\r\n- **Assessment:** Assessment is conducted through presentations where students explain how they used different parts of Python (syntax, libraries, etc.) to complete a real-world project. Feedback from peers and instructors will be considered as part of the overall evaluation.\r\n\r\nCourse objectives:\r\n1. Understand Python's core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\r\n2. Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\r\n3. Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\r\n4. Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\r\n5. Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects."}
