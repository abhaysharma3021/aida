They will also learn about operators and expressions that are core to Python\u2019s syntax.\n- **Assessment:** \n  - Completion of a series of quizzes assessing knowledge on basic syntax and data types, including true/false questions on correct usage and multiple-choice questions for identifying error-prone code snippets.\n\n**Task 2: Writing Simple Programs**\n- **Learning Activity:** \n   - Participants will complete hands-on coding exercises where they implement simple programs that use flow control (if statements, loops), functions, and basic libraries. The instructor will provide examples and encourage participants to debug their own errors.\n   - In this task, participants will be asked to create a program that uses a loop to count from 1 to 10 in increments of 2, and display the even numbers only.\n- **Assessment:** \n  - A series of coding exercises where participants write programs using the skills learned. The instructor will check for correct syntax, variable usage, function application, and control structures as part of these exercises.\n\n**Task 3: Using Standard Libraries**\n- **Learning Activity:** \n   - Participants will learn about Python's standard libraries by completing activities that demonstrate how to use modules like `math` for mathematical operations or `random` for generating random numbers. The instructor will provide demonstrations and hands-on examples.\n   - For instance, participants can write a program that uses the `math` library to calculate the square root of 16.\n- **Assessment:** \n  - Participants will be given a set of tasks where they need to apply modules from the Python standard library. They must include importing statements correctly and use the library functions properly as part of these assessments.\n\n**Task 4: Debugging Techniques**\n- **Learning Activity:** \n   - Participants will engage in interactive sessions where common programming errors are identified and fixed through practice exercises. The instructor will provide explanations for why certain code is problematic.\n   - In this task, participants might be asked to find the error in a piece of incorrect Python code that attempts to use an array from a library but fails due to type mismatch or missing import statements.\n- **Assessment:** \n  - Participants will submit corrected versions of their code after identifying and rectifying errors. The instructor will review these submissions, checking for accurate problem identification and solutions.\n\n**Task 5: Creating Real-World Projects**\n- **Learning Activity:** \n   - Participants will be tasked with working on a project where they must use all the skills learned in previous tasks (Python syntax, libraries, debugging). They can work individually or in pairs to create a basic application like a calculator that performs arithmetic operations.\n   - The instructor provides guidance and feedback as needed. For example, participants might need help integrating multiple modules together correctly or fixing issues related to importing external libraries.\n- **Assessment:** \n  - Participants will submit their completed project with explanations of the problems they encountered during development and how they resolved them using debugging techniques.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1.
