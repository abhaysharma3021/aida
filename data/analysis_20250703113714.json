Flask, a micro web framework, is ideal for developing small to medium-sized web applications. Throughout this course, learners will gain a solid understanding of Flask's core concepts, practical applications, and advanced techniques. By the end of the course, learners will be equipped with the skills to design, develop, and deploy their own web applications.\n\nThe course is structured into four modules, each focusing on a critical aspect of Flask web development. Starting with setting up the environment and introducing Flask, the course progresses through core concepts, practical applications, and finally, advanced topics. This structured approach ensures that learners build a strong foundation and can apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n### Cognitive Levels: Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, Creating\n\n- **Remembering**: Recall the basic components and setup required for a Flask application.\n- **Understanding**: Explain the core concepts of Flask, including routes, templates rendering, and request handling.\n- **Applying**: Develop a simple web application using Flask, applying essential skills.\n- **Analyzing**: Compare and contrast different methods for handling user requests and database interactions in Flask applications.\n- **Evaluating**: Assess the security measures and best practices for deploying Flask applications.\n- **Creating**: Design and implement an advanced Flask application that incorporates databases, authentication, and RESTful APIs.\n\n## Module Structure\n\n### ### Module1: Setting Up and Introduction\n#### Module Learning Objectives:\n- **Remembering**: Identify the prerequisites and setup required for a Flask development environment.\n- **Understanding**: Explain the basic structure and components of a Flask application.\n- **Applying**: Install Flask and create a simple \"Hello, World!\" application.\n\n#### Topics Covered:\n- Getting Started\n\n#### Key Activities:\n- **Practical Exercise 1.1**: Installing Flask and setting up a development environment.\n- **Practical Exercise 1.2**: Creating a basic \"Hello, World!\" Flask application.\n\n### ### Module2: Core Concepts\n#### Module Learning Objectives:\n- **Understanding**: Describe the essential skills required for Flask development, including routing, template rendering, and handling forms.\n- **Applying**: Apply essential skills to build a simple interactive web application.\n- **Analyzing**: Compare different methods for handling user inputs and forms in Flask.\n\n#### Topics Covered:\n- Essential Skills\n\n#### Key Activities:\n- **Practical Exercise 2.1**: Building a simple web application with multiple routes and template rendering.\n- **Practical Exercise 2.2**: Handling forms and user inputs in a Flask application.\n\n### ### Module3: Practical Applications\n#### Module Learning Objectives:\n- **Applying**: Develop a Flask application that demonstrates real-world usage, including database integration.\n- **Evaluating**: Assess the effectiveness of different database integration methods in Flask applications.\n- **Creating**: Design a practical Flask application that applies learned concepts.\n\n#### Topics Covered:\n- Real-world Usage\n\n#### Key Activities:\n- **Practical Exercise 3.1**: Integrating a database with a Flask application.\n- **Practical Exercise 3.2**: Building a simple blog application using Flask and a database.\n\n### ### Module4: Advanced Topics\n#### Module Learning Objectives:\n- **Understanding**: Explain advanced techniques in Flask, including RESTful APIs, authentication, and deployment strategies.\n- **Applying**: Implement RESTful APIs and authentication in a Flask application.\n- **Evaluating**: Assess the security and scalability of advanced Flask applications.\n\n#### Topics Covered:\n- Advanced Techniques\n\n#### Key Activities:\n- **Practical Exercise 4.1**: Building a RESTful API with Flask.\n- **Practical Exercise 4.2**: Implementing authentication and authorization in a Flask application.", "instructional_strategies": "Error connecting to Groq API: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for model `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` in organization `org_01jgjr5a7pfmt9qzvs7x8xsds9` service tier `on_demand` on tokens per day (TPD): Limit 500000, Used 500642, Requested 306.
