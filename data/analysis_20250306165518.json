They will engage in interactive coding exercises where they input simple Python code snippets that demonstrate their understanding.\n- **Assessment:** A series of multiple-choice questions that test students' ability to correctly identify variable assignment statements, the correct use of arithmetic operations, and understanding data types.\n\n**Task 2: Write and Execute Simple Programs**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will be guided through creating a simple program using Python's control structures (conditional statements and loops). The activity includes hands-on coding sessions where students write code to print numbers in ascending order or create conditional messages based on user input.\n- **Assessment:** Upon completion, students' programs are reviewed for correct syntax and functionality. A feedback session follows, discussing any issues encountered and how they were resolved.\n\n**Task 3: Utilize Standard Libraries**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will learn to import Python\u2019s standard library modules and use their functions, such as math operations or string manipulation methods like `.replace()`. They will be provided with a set of guided exercises where they identify the appropriate module for solving problems.\n- **Assessment:** Participants are assessed on whether they can correctly import libraries needed for their tasks, understand how to call specific library methods (e.g., importing and using functions from math or random), and successfully incorporate these into their programs.\n\n**Task 4: Effective Debugging Techniques**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will conduct simple debugging exercises, identifying errors in given code snippets. They will be instructed on basic debugging tools like Python\u2019s built-in debugger (`pdb`) to step through the execution of a program line by line, analyze error messages, and correct their mistakes.\n- **Assessment:** Exercises involve students fixing a few bugs in provided sample codes. Students' solutions are reviewed for logical correctness, efficiency, and adherence to best practices.\n\n**Task 5: Develop Real-world Projects**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will work on small projects that apply the skills they have learned to real-world problems such as creating a basic calculator or a simple text-based game using loops and conditional statements. They will collaborate in groups to discuss project ideas, plan out their solutions, and execute them.\n- **Assessment:** Each group\u2019s final product is evaluated based on functionality, user interface design, adherence to coding standards, and creativity. Feedback sessions provide constructive criticism for continuous improvement.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "course_topic": "Python Programmimg", "audience_type": "beginner", "terminal_objectives": "1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\r\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\r\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\r\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\r\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "generated_date": "March 06, 2025 at 16:55"}
