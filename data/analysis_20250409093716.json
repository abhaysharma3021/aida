Each session will include hands-on coding exercises where students practice writing code snippets and manipulating data.\n  - **Assessment:** Students will be assessed through quizzes where they are given short Python scripts to execute and interpret the output. They will also participate in a coding project requiring them to implement simple logic using core syntax elements.\n\n- **Task Name:** Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will engage in workshops that demonstrate how to structure complex problems into functions, utilize loops for iteration, and apply conditional statements. They will work on exercises where they practice writing complete programs from scratch, including the creation of input/output prompts, function calls, and integration of different control structures within a single program.\n  - **Assessment:** Assessment will be through an individual coding project that requires students to design and implement a program using functions, loops, and conditionals. The students will also be given a short programming test where they must apply the use of these constructs in various scenarios.\n\n- **Task Name:** Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will learn about Python\u2019s standard library by exploring specific modules (such as math, random, datetime) through lectures followed by guided practice sessions. They will conduct coding exercises where they integrate these modules into their own programs to solve problems or complete tasks that require the use of mathematical functions, date manipulation, etc.\n  - **Assessment:** Students will be assessed on a project in which they must apply at least two different modules from Python\u2019s standard library within their program. This will include submitting code and explaining how each module was used effectively.\n\n- **Task Name:** Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will engage in activities where they practice using tools like pdb (Python Debugger) for step-by-step execution, logging mechanisms for tracking variable values during runtime, and unit tests with frameworks such as unittest. They will participate in group discussions that focus on identifying common errors and how to debug them, including understanding error messages.\n  - **Assessment:** Students will be given an individual coding assignment where they must identify bugs in a provided piece of code. They are required to use debugging techniques and write test cases to validate their solutions. Additionally, students will be assessed through group activities where they work together on identifying common issues and refining effective debugging strategies.\n\n- **Task Name:** Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will undertake a series of guided project-based learning sessions focusing on developing applications or solving problems that require using multiple aspects covered in previous tasks (syntax, functions, control structures, libraries). Each session will include setting up a practical problem, breaking it down into components to be solved individually and then integrating them back together.\n  - **Assessment:** Students\u2019 work for these projects will be evaluated based on completeness of functionality, correctness of implementation, adherence to coding standards, and how well they applied skills learned throughout the course. A detailed feedback session is also planned where students present their projects and receive constructive criticism.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "course_topic": "Python Programmimg", "audience_type": "beginner", "terminal_objectives": "1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\r\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\r\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\r\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\r\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "generated_date": "April 09, 2025 at 09:37"}
