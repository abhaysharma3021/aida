{"audience_analysis": "", "task_analysis": "Task Analysis\r\n\r\n**Key Learning Tasks:**\r\n\r\n- **Task 1: Understand Python's Core Syntax**\r\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will be introduced to basic syntax, such as variable assignment (`x = 5`), arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), and simple control structures (if statements). They will also learn about data types including integers, floats, strings, and booleans.\r\n  - **Assessment:** Students will demonstrate their understanding by completing exercises that involve writing short Python scripts to perform basic calculations and making decisions based on user input.\r\n\r\n- **Task 2: Write and Execute Simple Programs**\r\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will be guided through creating a simple program that sums two numbers, prints the result, and handles errors gracefully using try-except blocks. They will also write a script to handle user inputs and manipulate lists.\r\n  - **Assessment:** Students will submit their programs for evaluation. The instructor will check if they correctly implement error handling and list operations.\r\n\r\n- **Task 3: Utilize Standard Libraries**\r\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will explore common Python libraries like `math` for mathematical functions, `random` for generating random numbers or strings, and `os` for interacting with the operating system. They will write programs that utilize these libraries to solve simple problems.\r\n  - **Assessment:** Students' programs should demonstrate their understanding by including at least one function from each library provided in a real-world context.\r\n\r\n- **Task 4: Develop Debugging and Testing Practices**\r\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will be introduced to basic debugging techniques, such as using Python's built-in debugger (`pdb`) or interactive console for simple scripts. They will also learn how to write test cases for their programs.\r\n  - **Assessment:** Students will submit a program with embedded debug points and explain what each step is doing in the context of handling user input validation.\r\n\r\n- **Task 5: Create Basic Projects Using Python**\r\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will work on small projects, such as creating a simple calculator app that can perform arithmetic operations based on user inputs. Another project could involve creating a script to manage a basic database (e.g., reading from and writing to files).\r\n  - **Assessment:** Students' final projects should show the ability to apply Python's core concepts in real-world applications, including error handling, data input/output management, and problem-solving.\r\n\r\nCourse objectives:\r\n\r\n1.
