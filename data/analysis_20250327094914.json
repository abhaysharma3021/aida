{"audience_analysis": "# Audience Analysis  \r\n**Profile:**  \r\n* **Course Topic:** Python Programming  \r\n* **Audience Type:** Beginner  \r\n* **Common Job Titles/Background:** 12th standard students, typically with basic computer literacy and little to no programming experience.  \r\n\r\n**Key Characteristics:**  \r\n* **Knowledge Base:** Limited exposure to programming and project management concepts.  \r\n* **Learning Style:** Likely to benefit from interactive, hands-on activities, visual aids, and real-life examples.  \r\n* **Motivation:** Interested in acquiring new technical skills that may help in academic and future career opportunities.  \r\n* **Needs:** Clear, step-by-step guidance; simplified explanations; and ample practice opportunities to build both programming and project management fundamentals.  \r\n\r\n**Implications for Instructional Design:**  \r\n* Use relatable examples and simple language.  \r\n* Incorporate multimedia elements (videos, interactive demos) to illustrate both Python programming and basic project management concepts.  \r\n* Provide opportunities for immediate application through projects or case studies that integrate planning, scheduling, and tool usage.", "task_analysis": "Task Analysis\r\n\r\n**Key Learning Tasks:**\r\n\r\n**Task 1: Understanding Core Syntax**\r\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will watch a series of instructional videos explaining basic syntax such as variables, data types, operators, control structures (if/else), loops, and functions. They will also practice by completing interactive exercises that reinforce these concepts.\r\n- **Assessment:** A quiz consisting of multiple-choice questions where students must identify which statement correctly represents Python syntax.\r\n\r\n**Task 2: Basic Program Execution**\r\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will be given a set of simple programming tasks (like writing a program to print \"Hello, World!\" or calculate the sum of two numbers) and instructed on how to write these programs in Python. They will then run their programs using an integrated development environment (IDE).\r\n- **Assessment:** A coding challenge where students are provided with an incomplete script and must add lines that correctly execute the program as specified by a problem description.\r\n\r\n**Task 3: Utilizing Libraries**\r\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will be introduced to basic Python libraries such as NumPy for numerical operations and Matplotlib for plotting graphs. They will learn how to import these libraries in their scripts, use them to perform tasks like array creation or graph visualization, and understand the output produced by each library.\r\n- **Assessment:** A project where students must create a simple application (e.g., a calculator that uses NumPy for advanced operations) using at least two of the introduced libraries. They will also write documentation explaining how their program works.\r\n\r\n**Task 4: Debugging Techniques**\r\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will be shown common errors encountered when writing Python code and taught strategies for debugging these issues, including using print statements to inspect values within functions or loops. They will then practice by applying these techniques on a series of exercises.\r\n- **Assessment:** An assessment with a set of programs that have intentionally introduced bugs. Students must identify the mistakes, correct them, and provide comments explaining why each change was necessary.\r\n\r\n**Task 5: Real-World Application**\r\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will choose a problem they want to solve (e.g., developing a web scraper or creating a game) and work in groups to develop a solution. They will be given guidance on how to implement their chosen project using Python, including researching necessary libraries or frameworks.\r\n- **Assessment:** A final presentation where each group presents the project they have developed, detailing what problems it solves, how it works, and any challenges encountered during development.\r\n\r\nCourse objectives:\r\n1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\r\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\r\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\r\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\r\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "course_topic": "Python Programmimg", "audience_type": "beginner", "terminal_objectives": "1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\r\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\r\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\r\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\r\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.", "generated_date": "March 27, 2025 at 09:49"}
