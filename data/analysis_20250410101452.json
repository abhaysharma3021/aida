They will also learn about loops such as for and while.\n- **Assessment:** A short quiz to check comprehension of the explanations given.\n\n**Task 2: Write Simple Programs Using Control Structures**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students work on guided exercises where they create simple programs that use control structures like if statements, else blocks, and basic for or while loops. They will also practice writing functions.\n- **Assessment:** Submitting code snippets and brief explanations of their functionality via a coding submission platform.\n\n**Task 3: Utilize Standard Libraries**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students are introduced to common Python libraries such as math for mathematical operations, random for generating random numbers, and time for handling timing. They will also learn how to import and use these libraries in their code.\n- **Assessment:** A project where students implement a basic algorithm (e.g., calculating Fibonacci sequence) using at least two of the introduced standard libraries.\n\n**Task 4: Develop Effective Debugging Skills**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students engage in exercises that require them to debug simple programs. They learn about common errors, and strategies like setting breakpoints and examining variables\u2019 values.\n- **Assessment:** A coding exercise where students receive a program with a bug (e.g., incorrect function call order) and must identify and fix the issue.\n\n**Task 5: Apply Python for Real-world Projects**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students work on small group projects that require them to apply their knowledge of basic syntax, control structures, libraries, and debugging. Each project will focus on a different real-world task (e.g., creating a calculator, implementing a simple game).\n- **Assessment:** Presenting the final project to the class and explaining how they used Python\u2019s features in it.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects."}
