They will also practice using data types such as integers, strings, and booleans by entering values and performing operations.\n  - **Assessment:** Students will be given quizzes that require them to write short Python programs from scratch, including input/output exercises and simple arithmetic operations.\n\n- **Task 2: Writing Simple Programs with Control Structures**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Through guided projects, students will create a program that uses if-statements and loops. For example, they might write a program that asks the user for their age and then outputs whether or not they are eligible to vote based on their input.\n  - **Assessment:** Students will complete projects where they have to structure their code using control structures like conditional statements (if, else) and repetition structures (for loops, while loops). Assessment will be through observation of the students' project submissions.\n\n- **Task 3: Utilizing Python Standard Libraries**\n  - **Learning Activity:** In class activities, students will learn about basic libraries such as math and random. They will use these built-in functions in simple programs to demonstrate their understanding.\n  - **Assessment:** Students will be provided with a set of exercises requiring them to import and utilize different parts of the standard library, like importing the math module to compute square roots or using the random module for generating sequences.\n\n- **Task 4: Developing Effective Debugging and Testing Skills**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Conduct weekly debugging sessions where students will encounter common bugs while coding. They will also engage in activities where they write small test programs that use assert statements to check if their code is working correctly.\n  - **Assessment:** Students will be required to submit short debug challenges, where they have a piece of erroneous Python code and must identify the issue and fix it by providing a corrected version.\n\n- **Task 5: Creating Basic Projects Using Python**\n  - **Learning Activity:** In small groups, students will work on developing simple projects like building a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations, or creating a program to draw shapes using turtle graphics.\n  - **Assessment:** Final assessment of this task will involve each group presenting their project to the class. The presentations should include an explanation of how they solved problems and what features were included in their designs.\n\nCourse objectives:\n\n1.Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2.Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n3.Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n4.Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n5.Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects."}
