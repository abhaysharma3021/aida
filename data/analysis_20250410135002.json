The instructor will guide them through basic syntax concepts such as variable assignment, data types (integers, strings), and control structures like if statements and for loops.\n  - **Assessment:** At the end of each session, students will be given a set of exercises to complete independently. These exercises will include both syntax-based questions and simple coding challenges that test their understanding of the concepts covered.\n\n- **Task 2: Write and Execute Simple Python Programs**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will work in pairs or small groups on collaborative projects. Each project will involve writing a program that performs a simple task, such as calculating the average of a list of numbers or printing out a greeting based on user input. The instructor will provide templates for these programs and guide students through debugging any errors they encounter.\n  - **Assessment:** At the end of each collaborative session, teams will present their completed projects to the class. Each team member will be responsible for explaining how their program works and addressing any questions from classmates or instructors.\n\n- **Task 3: Utilize Standard Libraries**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will engage in guided hands-on sessions where they learn about Python\u2019s standard library, including modules such as math for basic arithmetic operations and random to generate random numbers. They will use these libraries in their existing programs.\n  - **Assessment:** Individual quizzes will be given periodically throughout the course. These quizzes will include multiple-choice questions about various functions from different modules of the standard library, requiring students to recall information they have learned during class.\n\n- **Task 4: Develop Debugging and Testing Skills**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will use an integrated development environment (IDE) to write code in Python and run it. They will encounter errors and learn how to resolve them by using the built-in debugging tools of the IDE, such as breakpoints and error messages.\n  - **Assessment:** At regular intervals during the course, students will submit a set of exercises that involve identifying and fixing bugs in simple programs. These exercises may be in the form of fill-in-the-blank questions or short answer assessments where students must explain why their code is not working as expected.\n\n- **Task 5: Apply Python to Create Projects**\n  - **Learning Activity:** Students will work on a project that requires them to apply all the skills they have learned. This might be something like building a calculator, creating a simple game, or automating repetitive tasks using loops and conditionals.\n  - **Assessment:** Final projects will be presented and evaluated by peers as well as instructors. The evaluation criteria will include functionality, design, and adherence to best coding practices.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1. Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2. Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n3. Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n4. Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n5. Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects."}
