{"audience_analysis": "", "task_analysis": "Task Analysis\n\n**Key Learning Tasks:**\n\n**Task 1: Understand Python\u2019s Core Syntax**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will engage in a series of coding exercises where they must write Python code snippets that demonstrate understanding of basic syntax such as variables, data types (integers, strings), and simple mathematical expressions. They should also practice writing conditional statements like `if`, `elif`, and `else`. \n  - Activities: Writing several short programs.\n- **Assessment:** Students will be assessed on their ability to correctly write and execute the code snippets provided in homework assignments. This will include a mix of self-assessment, instructor feedback, and peer reviews.\n\n**Task 2: Write Basic Programs Using Control Structures**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will work through guided exercises where they are taught how to structure basic programs using loops (for and while), as well as the use of functions. They will also be introduced to exception handling.\n  - Activities: Completing a series of practice problems that require them to write programs with these constructs, debugging errors, and implementing correct syntax.\n- **Assessment:** Students' progress will be assessed through their ability to successfully complete these exercises, including both the quality of their code (syntax correctness) and their problem-solving approaches.\n\n**Task 3: Utilize Standard Libraries for Common Tasks**\n- **Learning Activity:** The class will cover basic use of Python\u2019s standard libraries such as `math`, `datetime`, `random` through a series of examples and hands-on exercises. Students will be encouraged to identify, install, and use these libraries in their own programs.\n  - Activities: Writing programs that incorporate multiple functions from the same library (e.g., using math for both trigonometry and operations with real numbers), as well as creating custom libraries or scripts that make heavy use of one or more specific standard libraries.\n- **Assessment:** Students will be assessed on their ability to find, install, and apply these standard libraries correctly in their programs. They\u2019ll also be given a project where they must implement at least three different functions from standard Python libraries into an application.\n\n**Task 4: Develop Debugging Skills**\n- **Learning Activity:** The class will provide exercises focused solely on debugging, using sample code with intentional errors. Students will learn and practice techniques such as logging values, using print statements, and understanding the differences between syntax and runtime errors.\n  - Activities: Exercises that involve a series of broken programs to debug, identifying what went wrong, and fixing it.\n- **Assessment:** The students' performance in debugging exercises will be assessed based on how many errors they can find and fix within a given time frame.\n\n**Task 5: Apply Python to Real Projects**\n- **Learning Activity:** Students will work on building real-world applications that require the use of what they have learned (control structures, basic libraries, etc.). The projects could include simple games, data processing tools, or even integrating with external APIs.\n  - Activities: Students will be given an initial task and then provided resources to learn more about project requirements. They will develop their own project plan, write code for each part of the application (including documentation), and present their work at the end of the course.\n- **Assessment:** The projects will be assessed on several criteria including functionality, correctness, adherence to best coding practices, ability to debug issues that arise during development, and overall effectiveness. Peer reviews, instructor feedback, and submission of final code as part of a portfolio will also be used for evaluation.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1.
