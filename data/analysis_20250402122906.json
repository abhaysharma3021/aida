{"audience_analysis": "# Audience Analysis  \nProfile:  \n* Course Topic: Python Programming  \n* Audience Type: Beginner  \n* Common Job Titles/Background: 12th standard students, typically with basic computer literacy and little to no programming experience.  \n\nKey Characteristics:  \n* Knowledge Base: Limited exposure to programming and project management concepts.  \n* Learning Style: Likely to benefit from interactive, hands-on activities, visual aids, and real-life examples.  \n* Motivation: Interested in acquiring new technical skills that may help in academic and future career opportunities.  \n* Needs: Clear, step-by-step guidance; simplified explanations; and ample practice opportunities to build both programming and project management fundamentals.  \n\nImplications for Instructional Design:  \n* Use relatable examples and simple language.  \n* Incorporate multimedia elements (videos, interactive demos) to illustrate both Python programming and basic project management concepts.  \n* Provide opportunities for immediate application through projects or case studies that integrate planning, scheduling, and tool usage.", "task_analysis": "Task Analysis\n\n**Key Learning Tasks:**\n\n- **Task 1:** Understand Python's core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n  - **Learning Activity:** Participants will be introduced to the basics of Python through interactive code sessions where they can input lines of code directly in a virtual environment. They will also complete brief quizzes that reinforce their understanding of fundamental terms like variables, operators, and simple control structures such as if statements and loops.\n  - **Assessment:** Assessment will involve both multiple-choice questions about syntax rules and hands-on exercises requiring them to write correct Python programs without errors.\n\n- **Task 2:** Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n  - **Learning Activity:** Participants will engage in guided activities that demonstrate writing basic programs. They will start with simple functions, progressing to more complex applications involving loops and conditional statements. This will include working on a project where they create their own short program from scratch.\n  - **Assessment:** Students\u2019 progress will be assessed through individual coding assignments, where they have to develop a functional application that incorporates multiple elements of control structures and functions.\n\n- **Task 3:** Utilize standard libraries and modules to perform common programming tasks.\n  - **Learning Activity:** Participants will learn how to use Python's extensive library system by interacting with sample code. They will be given tutorials on using popular modules such as math, random, datetime, etc., and practice integrating these into their own scripts or projects.\n  - **Assessment:** Assessment for this task includes practical application tests where students must demonstrate the ability to import and utilize libraries effectively in solving a specific problem.\n\n- **Task 4:** Develop effective debugging and testing practices to ensure code reliability.\n  - **Learning Activity:** Participants will be introduced to debugging techniques by working through examples and exercises. They'll learn how to use basic Python tools like print statements, try/except blocks, and unit tests, and practice these methods on their own projects.\n  - **Assessment:** The assessment for this task will consist of a written test where students must identify bugs in provided code snippets, along with practical sessions where they work through debugging their own programs.\n\n- **Task 5:** Apply Python skills to create basic, real-world projects.\n  - **Learning Activity:** Participants will engage in small group activities that involve developing mini-programs or solutions based on specific problems. They will also receive guidance and support as they design and implement a larger project of their choice using Python.\n  - **Assessment:** The final assessment for this task will be an end-of-course project where participants demonstrate comprehensive application skills by creating a program that solves a real-world problem, including documentation to explain how the solution works.\n\nCourse objectives:\n1. Understand Python\u2019s core syntax, data types, and basic programming concepts.\n2. Write and execute simple Python programs using control structures and functions.\n3.
